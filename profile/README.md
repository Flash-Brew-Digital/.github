**Ideas, brewed fast.**

We're a product studio based in Melbourne, Australia, working with clients around the globe. We build MVPs, portals, automations, and mini apps in focused two-week sprints.

We took the slow drip out of development. No bloated timelines. No tepid results. Just good product, shipped.

### What we do

We help founders and businesses bring digital products to life quickly and without the usual overhead.

- **MVPs and prototypes** to validate your idea in weeks, not months
- **Client portals and dashboards** that give your customers or team a clean, functional interface
- **Automations and integrations** to connect your tools and cut out manual work
- **Internal tools and mini apps** that solve specific problems

### How we work

We like our builds like we like our coffee: strong, smooth, and ready fast.

- **Two-week sprints** with focused builds and real results each cycle
- **AI-assisted development** for speed without cutting corners
- **Flexible terms** so you can pause or cancel anytime
- **Async-first communication** with weekly check-ins and Slack updates
- **Global reach** from Melbourne, working with clients everywhere

### Open source

We create and maintain open source tools we think others might find useful.

**[Form Attribution](https://github.com/Flash-Brew-Digital/form-attribution)**
A lightweight, zero-dependency script that captures UTM parameters, referrer data, and ad click IDs, then passes them to your forms as hidden fields. Privacy-respecting, XSS-safe, and works with dynamically loaded forms.

**[Create Webflow Extension](https://github.com/Flash-Brew-Digital/create-webflow-extension)**
A CLI tool to scaffold new Webflow Designer Extension projects. Run `npx create-webflow-extension@latest` and follow the prompts.

**[Webflow Extension Starter](https://github.com/Flash-Brew-Digital/webflow-extension-starter)**
A minimal starter template for building Webflow Designer Extensions with React, TypeScript, and Rspack. Includes custom hooks for common Designer API patterns.
